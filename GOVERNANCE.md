# Governance

Auxide follows a single-maintainer stewardship model.

- **Maintainer**: Michael A. Kuykendall (@Michael-A-Kuykendall)
- **Decision authority**: The maintainer is the final arbiter for roadmap, architecture, and merges.
- **PR policy**: Unsolicited PRs are closed without merge. Contributions are considered only after direct alignment with the maintainer (see CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Ownership enforcement**: CODEOWNERS requires maintainer review for all changes. Branch protection should enforce CODEOWNERS review on the default branch.
- **Licensing**: MIT. Forks and derivative works are permitted under the license; upstream merges remain at maintainer discretion.
